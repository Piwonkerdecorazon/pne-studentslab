In the second iteration of the f function the debug tool shows us that the program stopped due to an error in the
calculations. diving deeper into the function f called using the debug tool we can see that the internal variable
of t1 is equal to zero according to our program. This causes an error because the program later on will try to divide
with this variable in the denominator. It is not possible to divide by zero then an error shows up.
